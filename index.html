        An evil computer has taken over your game of Battleship! Show this
        up-jumped punch card that humanity won't be conquered so easily and sink
        all of its ships!<br /><br />Using your wired mouse peripheral,
        left-click empty spaces on the computer's board to attack. If you hit a
        ship the space wil turn red, and if you sink it the entire ship will
        turn black! All ships are between 2 and 5 spaces long and must be in a
        straight line. Sink the evil computer's ships before it can sink yours
        and make humanity proud!
